5</span>KING DIDERIK AND THE LION&rsquo;S FIGHT WITH THE
DRAGON</h2>
<p>From Bern rode forth King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stately warrior form;<br />
Engaged in fray he found in the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A lion and laidly worm. <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>They fought for a day, they fought for two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ere the third was flown,<br />
The worm outfought the beast, and brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To earth the lion down.</p>
<p>Then cried the lion in his need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he the warrior saw:<br />
&ldquo;O aid me quick, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To &rsquo;scape the Dragon&rsquo;s claw.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;O aid me quick, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mighty God thou fearest;<br />
A lion save for the lion brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which on thy shield thou bearest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to my rescue, thou noble King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Help, help me for thy name;<br />
Upon thy targe I stand at large,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glittering like a flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long, long stood he, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep musing thereupon;<br />
At length he cried: &ldquo;Whate&rsquo;er betide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help thee, noble one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His good sword bare he made:<br />
With courage fraught, the worm he fought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till blood tinged all the blade.</p>
<p>The gallant lord would not delay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fast his blows he dealt;<br />
He hacked and gored until his sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was sundered at the hilt.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>The Lindworm took him upon her back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The horse beneath her tongue;<br />
To her mountain den she hurried then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her eleven young.</p>
<p>The horse she cast before her young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in a nook she throws:<br />
&ldquo;Assuage your greed upon the steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will to repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray ye feed upon the steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At present no more I can;<br />
When I upleap, refreshed, from sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll feast upon the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hill he searched around;<br />
Then, helped by the Lord, the famous sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Called Adelring he found.</p>
<p>Aye there he found so sharp a sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a knife with a golden heft:<br />
&ldquo;King Sigfred be God&rsquo;s grace with thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For here thy life was reft!</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with thee in many a fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In many an inroad too,<br />
But that thy doom had been in this tomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never, never knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would prove the faulchion&rsquo;s might;<br />
He hewed upon the flinty stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Till all around was light.</p>
<p>It was the youngest Lindworm saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sparks the hill illume:<br />
&ldquo;Who dares awake the fiery snake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her own sleeping room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lindworm gnashed its teeth with rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its grinning fangs it show&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Who dares awake the mother snake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within her own abode?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then spake the other little ones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dark nooks of the hill:<br />
&ldquo;If from her sleep the old one leap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill fare with thee but ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Then answered Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes with fury gleam:<br />
&ldquo;I will awake your mother snake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With chilly, chilly dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother she King Sigfred slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A man of noble line;<br />
I&rsquo;ll on ye all avenge his fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With this good hand of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then awaked the Lindworm old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on her fell such fear:<br />
&ldquo;Who thus with riot disturbs my quiet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What noise is this I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said King Diderik: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this have I to say:<br />
O&rsquo;er hill and dale, &rsquo;neath thy crooked tail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou brought&rsquo;st me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O hew me not, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give thee all my hoard;<br />
&rsquo;Twere best that we good friends should be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So cast away thy sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;I pay no trust to thy false device,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Befool me thou wouldst fain;<br />
Full many hast thou destroyed ere now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou never shalt again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, Sir King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbear to do me ill,<br />
And thee I&rsquo;ll guide to thy plighted bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s hidden in the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above by my head, King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is hung the little key;<br />
Below by my feet to the maiden sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Descend thou fearlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above by thy head, thou serpent curst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin I now intend;<br />
Below by thy feet, as is full meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I soon shall make an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then first the laidly worm he slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then her young he smote;<br />
But in vain did he try from the mountain to fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For tongues of snakes thrust out.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>So then with toil in the rocky soil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He dug a trench profound,<br />
That in the flood of serpent blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bane he might not be drowned.</p>
<p>Then bann&rsquo;d the good King Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the lion he wroth became:<br />
&ldquo;Bann&rsquo;d, bann&rsquo;d,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may the
lion be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confusion be his and shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With subtle thought the brute has brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On me this grievous risk;<br />
Which I ne&rsquo;er had seen had he not been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Graved on my buckler&rsquo;s disc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the gallant lion heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King bewail his hap:<br />
&ldquo;Stand fast, good lord,&rdquo; the lion roared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;While with my claws I scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion scrapp&rsquo;d, King Diderik hewed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright sparks the gloom relieved;<br />
Unless the beast had the knight released<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d soon to death have grieved.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>So when he had slain the laidly worm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her offspring all had kill&rsquo;d;<br />
Escaped the knight to the morning light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With heavy cuirass and shield.</p>
<p>And when he had now come out of the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his gallant courser he sighed;<br />
With reason good he trust him could,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they had each other tried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O there&rsquo;s no need to bewail the steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which thou, Sir King, hast miss&rsquo;d;<br />
I am thy friend, my back ascend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ride where&rsquo;er thou list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he rode o&rsquo;er the deepest dales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er the verdant meads;<br />
The knight he rode, the lion strode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the dim forest glades.</p>
<p>The lion and King Diderik<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together thenceforth remain;<br />
Each death had braved, and the other saved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From peril sore and pain.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Where&rsquo;er King Diderik rode in the fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lion beside him sped;<br />
When on the ground the knight sat down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his bosom he laid his head.</p>
<p>Wherefore they call him the lion knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fame that name he bore;<br />
Their love so great did ne&rsquo;er abate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until their dying hour.</p>

14</span>DIDERIK AND OLGER THE DANE</h2>
<p>With his eighteen brothers Diderik stark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwells in the hills of Bern;<br />
And each I wot twelve sons has got,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For manly feats they yearn.</p>
<p>He has twelve sisters, each of them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dozen sons can show;<br />
Thirteen the youngest, gallant lads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fear who nothing know.</p>
<p>To stand before the King a crowd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of giant bodies move;<br />
I say to ye forsooth their heads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;ertopped the beechen grove.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;With knights of pride we war have plied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For many, many a year;<br />
Of Olger, who in Denmark reigns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such mighty things we hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men talk so fain of Olger Dane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who dwells in Jutland&rsquo;s fields;<br />
Crowned is his head with gold so red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No tribute us he yields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Swerting took a mace, and shook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That mace right furiously:<br />
&ldquo;From ten times ten of Olger&rsquo;s men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not look to flee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, Swerting, hark, of visage dark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Esteem them not so little;<br />
I&rsquo;d have thee ken that Olger&rsquo;s men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are knights of gallant mettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They feel no fright for faulchions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For arrows no dismay;<br />
The desperate fight is their delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They deem it children&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Then cried the mighty man of Bern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When pondered long had he:<br />
&ldquo;To Denmark we will wend, and learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At home if Olger be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took their route from Berner land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They eighteen thousand were;<br />
King Olger good they visit would,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to Denmark all repair.</p>
<p>A messenger by Diderik sent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Danish Olger goes:<br />
&ldquo;Say, will ye tribute pay to us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or with us bandy blows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then full of wrath King Olger grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such speech he could not bear:<br />
&ldquo;Let Diderik meet us on the wold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll battle with him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tribute to pay each Dane would scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s wont himself to take it;<br />
Our tribute ye will like but ill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If ye come here to seek it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>His kemps then gathering in a ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The news to them he told:<br />
&ldquo;Bern&rsquo;s haughty lord has sent us word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he&rsquo;ll have tribute-gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll either tribute have, or hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With us a bloody feud;<br />
But the first King he will not be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have this year subdued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then cried in scorn a kempion good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; King Diderik&rsquo;s envoy to:<br />
&ldquo;To waste our home if Berners come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They all hence out won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon as the news he heard, full glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Ulf Van Yern, and gay;<br />
Then laughed outright bold Hogen knight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Too long do they delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High beat with joy his heart;<br />
Then said amain Orm Ungerswayne:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;To meet them let us start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;The first man I&rsquo;ll be in the van,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Ivor Blue he cried:<br />
&ldquo;Nor shall ye say that I was last,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Kulden Gray replied.</p>
<p>King Olger on the verdant wold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Diderik battle join&rsquo;d;<br />
To fight they went, no jest they meant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wroth were they in mind.</p>
<p>Endured for three long days the fray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flinch would neither side;<br />
To help his lord each Dane his sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In desperation plied.</p>
<p>Down ran the blood, like raging flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which &rsquo;neath steep hills doth pour;<br />
Then tribute they were forced to pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who tribute asked before.</p>
<p>Rose in the sky the blood-reek high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dimmed the lustrous sun;<br />
&rsquo;Twas sad to spy the brave men lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So thick the earth upon.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>In gore lay thick both men and steeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear friends were parted there;<br />
All did not laugh the feast who sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too hot they found the fare.</p>
<p>Now tamer grown, the Berner Jutt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought thus himself within:<br />
&ldquo;Of us a hundred scarce remain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot hope to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then took he to his heels and ran,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not often back looked he;<br />
To say good night forgot Swerting quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Bern, for Bern they flee.</p>
<p>Then Diderik turned him with a shout<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That shook the vaulted skies:<br />
&ldquo;Bern, Bern&rsquo;s the place for us, I guess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For here no refuge lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered &rsquo;neath the green hill&rsquo;s side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The son of Verland keen:<br />
&ldquo;Ye and your host will little boast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye have in Denmark been.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Full eighteen thousand knights were they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When out they marched from Bern;<br />
Wounded and worn but seventy-five<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With drooping crests, return.</p>

21</span>OLGER THE DANE AND BURMAN</h2>
<p>Burman in the mountain holds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes his shield shine brightly there;<br />
A message he sends to Iceland&rsquo;s King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he has a daughter fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, good King of Iceland, hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear what now I say to thee:<br />
Give to me thy daughter fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And divide thy land with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either yield thy daughter fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And divide with me thy land,<br />
Or the warrior good prepare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in fight can me withstand.&rdquo;</p>

And the Damsel Gloriant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To receive him gently rose.</p>

Burman in the mountain holds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He would win thee and doth woo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burman is a kempion dour,<br />

He will surely have thee soon,<br />

<p>It was Damsel Gloriant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her blue mantle o&rsquo;er her threw;<br />
Swiftly to the prison tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the prisoners lay she flew.</p>
<p>It was Damsel Gloriant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Bove the prisoners all she cried:<br />
&ldquo;Hear thou, Olger good, the Dane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have thy legs yet power to stride?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing will he eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the flesh of Christian men;<br />
And nothing, nothing, will he drink<br />

<p>Olger from the tower they took,<br />

<p>Burman riding came to court,<br />

Olger the Dane against him rode,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
